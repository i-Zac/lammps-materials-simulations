Welcome! This is a personal collection of beginner-level materials simulation projects using [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), [ATOMK](https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr/) and [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/). These projects were developed during my self-directed learning journey in molecular dynamics for materials science.

> 🟡 This work is part of my learning journey in materials simulation. I'm currently exploring and learning. I'm very open to research opportunities, mentorship, collaborations, or support that can help me grow in this space.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

Each project simulates different materials systems using molecular dynamics. The simulations involve:
- Generating atomic structures
- Applying deformations or thermal effects
- Visualising atomic behaviour
- Analysing outputs like stress-strain curves and dislocation patterns
