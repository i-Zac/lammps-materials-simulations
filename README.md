# 🧪 LAMMPS-Based Materials Simulations (Beginner Projects)

Welcome! This is a personal collection of beginner-level materials simulation projects using [LAMMPS](https://www.lammps.org/), [ATOMK](https://atomsk.univ-lille.fr/) and [OVITO](https://www.ovito.org/). These projects were developed during my self-directed learning journey in molecular dynamics for materials science.

> 🟡 I'm currently exploring and learning. I'm very open to research opportunities, mentorship, collaborations, or support that can help me grow in this space.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here

Each project simulates different materials systems using molecular dynamics. The simulations involve:
- Generating atomic structures
- Applying deformations or thermal effects
- Visualising atomic behaviour
- Analysing outputs like stress-strain curves and dislocation patterns

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Al-10%Cu Simulation](https://github.com/i-Zac/lammps-materials-simulations/tree/6dbde764fa9cd9119d57ec6b5db09bbb8341e20b/Al10_Cu%20(1)) | Simulates tensile behavior of Al-10%Cu and visualizes dislocation motion |
| [AlMgC Atom Creation]([https://github.com/i-Zac/lammps-mgc](https://github.com/i-Zac/lammps-materials-simulations/tree/main/AlMgC%20(1))) | Shows how to create an Alloy of  components/atoms
| [Cantor Alloy Study](https://github.com/i-Zac/lammps-cantor-alloy) | Explores compositional stability in high-entropy alloys |

More projects will be added as I continue to learn and experiment.
